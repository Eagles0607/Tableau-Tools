# Tableau-Tools
A collection of tools for working with Tableau.

### The Ruby Workbook gem &mdash; 'twb'

The foundation of the Ruby Tableau Tools, the twb gem provides access to a Tableau workbook's internals. It works with normal *twb* and packaged *twbx* workbooks.


Twb also offers methods for manipulating Workbooks, including updating and adding content, and writing them out as valid *.twb files.
